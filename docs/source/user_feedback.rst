.. admonition:: PyRPL was developed for and is one of the core components of three ongoing experiments in Quantum Cavity Optomechanics

   in the `Optomechanics and Quantum Measurement Group <http://www.lkb.upmc.fr/optomecanics/>`_ at `Laboratoire Kastler Brossel in Paris <http://www.lkb.upmc.fr/>`_.


.. admonition:: "I am trying PyRPL to see if we can replace the really expensive ZI-lockings to generate parametric feedback at low frequencies."

   Dr. Pau Mestres from `Rainer Blatt's Quantum Optics and Spectroscopy Group <http://www.quantumoptics.at/en/>`_ at `University of Innsbruck <https://www.uibk.ac.at/>`_.


.. admonition:: "I just wanted to say thanks for putting together (and making publicly available) the Pyrpl software. Myself and a couple of postdocs actually had some good fun downloading your windows executable and setting up a PDH lock to one of our optical test cavities last week. It is remarkable to me that anything associated with high speed DSP on an FPGA could be considered “fun,” but from unboxing the red pitaya to locking the cavity took maybe 4 hours of work. "

   Dr. Gordon A. Shaw, `Mass and Force Group <https://www.nist.gov/pml/quantum-measurement-division/mass-and-force>`_ at the `Quantum Metrology division <https://www.nist.gov/pml/quantum-measurement>`_ of the `National Institude of Standards and Technology (NIST) <https://www.nist.gov/>`_.


.. admonition:: "IT WORKS! Thanks for your wonderful project :)"

   Dr. Kun Huang from the `State Key Laboratory of Precesion Spectroscopy <http://www.lps.ecnu.edu.cn/>`_ at `East China Normal University <http://english.ecnu.edu.cn/>`_.
