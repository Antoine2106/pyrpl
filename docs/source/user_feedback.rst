Feedback by happy PyRPL users
*********************************


.. admonition:: PyRPL was developed for and is one of the core components of three ongoing experiments in Quantum Cavity Optomechanics

   in the `Optomechanics and Quantum Measurement Group <http://www.lkb.upmc.fr/optomecanics/>`_ at `Laboratoire Kastler Brossel in Paris <http://www.lkb.upmc.fr/>`_.


.. admonition:: "I am trying PyRPL to see if we can replace the really expensive ZI-lockings to generate parametric feedback at low frequencies."

   Dr. Pau Mestres from `Rainer Blatt's Quantum Optics and Spectroscopy Group <http://www.quantumoptics.at/en/>`_ at `University of Innsbruck <https://www.uibk.ac.at/>`_.


.. admonition:: "IT WORKS! Thanks for your wonderful project :)"

   Dr. Kun Huang from the `State Key Laboratory of Precesion Spectroscopy <http://www.lps.ecnu.edu.cn/>`_ at `East China Normal University <http://english.ecnu.edu.cn/>`_.


.. admonition:: "Brilliant toolbox with an impressive number of functionalities. After quickly tuning a few parameters, we were able to lock our Fabry-Perot cavity with almost no effort."

   Dr. Jérôme Degallaix from the `Laboratoire des Matériaux Avancés in Lyon <http://lma.in2p3.fr/>`_.


.. admonition:: PyRPL is furthermore used by

   * Dr. Gordon A. Shaw, `Mass and Force Group <https://www.nist.gov/pml/quantum-measurement-division/mass-and-force>`_ at the `Quantum Metrology division <https://www.nist.gov/pml/quantum-measurement>`_ of the `National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <https://www.nist.gov/>`_.
   * Team of Dr. Jonas Schou Neergaard-Nielsen at the `Quantum Physics and Information Technology division <http://www.fysik.dtu.dk/english/Research/QPIT>`_ of the `Technical University of Denmark <http://www.dtu.dk/english>`_,
   * Development team at `Sacher Lasertechnik <https://www.sacher-laser.com/>`_.

..   * Team of Dr. Pierre Verlot in the `Luminescence Group <http://ilm.univ-lyon1.fr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&catid=28>`_ at `ILM <http://ilm.univ-lyon1.fr/>`_, `University Claude Bernard Lyon 1 <https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/>`_,

If you are happily using PyRPL as wll and would like to help to promote the project, please send your feedback to `pyrpl.readthedocs.io@gmail.com <mailto:pyrpl.readthedocs.io@gmail.com>`_ and we will include your voice on this page.
